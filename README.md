# ESPHome Smart Coffee (Philips Series 2200) [![CI](https://github.com/TillFleisch/ESPHome-Philips-Smart-Coffee/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/TillFleisch/ESPHome-Philips-Smart-Coffee/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

This project integrates a Philips Series 2200 Coffee Machine into into [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) through [ESPHome](https://esphome.io).
This component has been developed on a Philips EP2220 and an ESP8266.

This component provides a `Power Switch`, a `Status sensor` and various `Buttons` which simulate user input.
The `Power Switch` can be used to turn on the coffee machine with and without a cleaning cycle during startup.

You might break/brick your coffee machine by modifying it in any way, shape or form. If you want to use this component, do so at your own risk.

# Configuration variables

# Fully automated coffee

The following script can be used to make a fully automated cup of coffee.
The power switch used in this case does not perform a cleaning cycle.
The cleaning check is required since after power loss the machine always cleans.
This script will only continue to brew coffee under 2 conditions:

- There was no cleaning cycle during start-up
- A Mug is present

```yaml
script:
  - id: coffee_script
    then:
      - if:
          condition:
            lambda: 'return id(status).state == "OFF";'
          then:
            - switch.turn_on: power
            - wait_until:
                condition:
                  lambda: 'return (id(status).state == "Idle") || (id(status).state == "Cleaning");'
                timeout: 120s
            - if:
                condition:
                  lambda: 'return (id(status).state == "Idle") && id(mug_sensor).state;'
                then:
                  - delay: 5s
                  - button.press: make_coffee_button
          else:
            if:
              condition:
                lambda: 'return (id(status).state == "Idle") && id(mug_sensor).state;'
              then:
                - button.press: make_coffee_button
```

# Wiring

The coffee machines display unit is connected to the mainboard via a 8-pin ribbon cable with Picoflex connectors.
The display is powered by the mainboard and the two units communicate using a serial bus.
The ESP is placed in between this bus to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
The RX/TX lines are piped through the ESP such that messages can be read, intercepted and injected.

When injecting a 'turn coffee machine on' command, the coffee machine does turn on, but the display unit does not. To circumvent this behavior we can re-boot the display unit by temporarily removing it's power. Thus the display will power on and operate normally. To perform this operation a transistor or MOSFET can be used.

The following wiring guideline can be used to add a Wemos D1 Mini to the coffee machine. **The unlabeled wires should be connected without changes.**
![Wiring guide](wiring.png)

The ribbon cable wires have the following functionalities.

| Pin | Mainboard | Functionality                      |
| --- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0   | 5V        | 5V                                 |
| 1   | GND       | GND                                |
| 2   | GND       | GND                                |
| 3   | unused    | unused                             |
| 4   | TX/RX     | Messages from mainboard to display |
| 5   | RX/TX     | Messages from display to mainboard |
| 6   | 0V        | unknown - very noisy               |
| 7   | 5V        |                                    |

## Voltage regulation

The Wemos D1 Mini has a built in Voltage regulator, thus connecting it to the 5V provided by the mainboard is no problem. If you use a different ESP Module/Board please make sure it is 5V tolerant or use a Voltage regulator. Otherwise you might release magic smoke.

  - The commands used in this Project are different. This is likely due to different model revisions.

# Troubleshooting

- Make sure your wiring is correct
- The UART debug function can be used to analyze communication and verify correct wiring
- The commands used by the display unit may be different between different revisions/models (see Related Work)
